Python Gui for Elastic. Search results into Dataframes by default.

This is my first python program and also the beginning of a project that was ultimately scrapped. On my own test system with a VM running Elasticsearch/Kibana, I was able to perform basic search queries, retrieve the results in the form of a Pandas Dataframe, and either sort it via GUI, manipulate it further via terminal session or export it to Excel. I've tried to minimize dependency on external packages; numpy, pandas, openpyxl and their dependencies are all you should need to pull down with pip, possibly tkinter if it is not part of your python distribution.

I have no plans at the time to continue development on this, but if it helps anyone else I would love to know.
